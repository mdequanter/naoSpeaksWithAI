Models from the DodecaDialogue Paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03768)

14 subdirs; 
- `all_tasks_mt/` is the true multitask model
- 12 other task specific foldres, contain the best MT+FT model for each task
- `dict/` contains the dictionar


Important note: the ELI5 model in the zoo is the one that scored the highest ROUGE scores; it may have slightly lower f1, bleu, and slightly higher ppl than the numbers reported in the dodeca paper.
